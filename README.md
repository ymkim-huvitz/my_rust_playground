## About Rust

[Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/) is a systems programming language that focuses on performance, reliability, and productivity. It empowers developers to build fast and efficient software while preventing common programming errors.

### Why Rust?

- **Memory Safety**: Rust's ownership system ensures memory safety without sacrificing performance.
- **Concurrency**: Built-in concurrency primitives enable efficient parallel programming.
- **Ecosystem**: A growing ecosystem of libraries and tools supports various application domains.

## Projects

Explore my Rust projects and see how I apply Rust to solve real-world problems.

1. [Hello World](./hello_world): My first rust "Hello World".
2. [Project Two](./projects/project_two): Another exciting project with Rust. (not yet)

Feel free to dive into the project directories for detailed information and source code.

## Challenges

Challenge yourself with Rust coding exercises and improve your skills.

1. [Challenge One](./challenges/challenge_one): Description and solution for the first Rust challenge. (not yet)

## Contributing
